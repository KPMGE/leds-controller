# Leds Controller

This is just a really simple project to warm me up with the *flutter* framework and the *nodemcu* microcontroller.
The idea here is that, the *flutter* app will connect to the *nodemcu* endpoint and send some requests to it. 
So that, it will be possible to turn on and off some LEDs remotely, just using the app.


## The app
The app was completely made using the  [flutter](https://flutter.dev/) framework, this one was made by google and 
is one of the most powerful ones to create cross-platform apps nowdays. 

The final application itself is pretty easy, but by building it it was possible to learn a lot about how a flutter project
should be structured and the differences between it and *React Native*, the framework that i have used already. One of the most 
interesting things that i noticed when creating the *flutter* app was that, once you get used to its idea of components, you 
can literally build anything you want, as almost everything in *flutter* is, at the end of the day, a widget. 

That idea was completely new to me, as in *React Native* things work a little differently. Moreover, the documentation was super helpful,
as there is even an explanation of how flutter works for people who have a *React Native* background. In short, the app development was
super interesting and enjoyable!

### App Result
The final result was pretty simple, yet i think it's looking kinda pretty, as i have used the material design.
